After the Deluge, also known as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil painting by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows a scene from the story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach.
N661US is an aircraft that was built by Boeing as the prototype of the Boeing 747-400, a modernized version of the Boeing 747. The plane rolled off the assembly line on January 26, 1988, and had its first flight on April 29, 1988. After the conclusion of the 747-400 flight testing program, Boeing delivered the aircraft to Northwest Airlines on December 8, 1989. The aircraft was involved in the Northwest Airlines Flight 85 incident, in which it experienced a lower rudder hardover event. This occurs when an aircraft's rudder deflects to its travel limit without crew input. The pilots were able to overcome the issue and land safely. The problem was blamed on metal fatigue, and an airworthiness directive was issued to prevent the possibility of a future accident.
